# AB0403-Project
<p>This project was created as part of AB0403: Decision Making with Programming and Data Analytics Final Project in collaboration with my teammates, Andy Kwek, Dylah Puah, See Weng, and Lin Xu. </p>
<p>In Part 1 of the Project, we were tasked with creating a Python-based program that could understand the customers' needs, suggest relevant insurance plans within the broad theme selected, and guide the customer to plan their insurance policies most relevant to their needs. I led the team in the development of a proof-of-concept program that uses programming to deliver more tailored services. The program suggests relevant insurance policies based on the customer's interests and given criteria, with the goal of improving the customer experience. </p>
<p>In Part 2 of the Project, we were tasked with analyzing a dataset of accident claims from an insurance company using the Python Pandas library to identify trends and relationships between accident claims and the likelihood of future accidents. We further provided solutions to improve the profitability of the fictitious insurance company by adjusting premiums based on the proposed framework in line with our analysis. </p>
